## Rare animal Classification

### Dataset
Dataset Link: https://bit.ly/animalink-dataset

### Requirements
To run the notebook and utilize the model, the following dependencies are required:
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Pickle
- Scikit-learn

### Classification Image Step
1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnimaLink/Machine-Learning-app.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies.
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy scipy
```
3. Navigate to the classification directory and open the notebooks.
4. Specify the source directory of the dataset you have saved
5. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.
6. Use the saved model for inference in your applications.
